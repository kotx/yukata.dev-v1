Hey, I'm Kot! I'm a comp sci student at the University of Wisconsin.

I've made a variety of software and hardware projects, from [object storage proxies](https://github.com/kotx/render) to [microcontrollers for motion controls](https://github.com/kotx/laplace)!
Here's a list:
- [render](https://github.com/kotx/render), a spec-compliant Cloudflare Worker to serve objects from a Cloudflare R2 storage bucket.
- [laplace](https://github.com/kotx/laplace), a program to use a Raspberry Pi Pico microcontroller for Cemuhook-compatible motion controls!
- [shovel](https://github.com/kotx/shovel), a client for placing lots of pixels on [Place IPv6](https://v6.sys42.net/).
- [recorder](https://github.com/kotx/recorder), a Rust crate to simplify data struct creation.
- [this website](https://github.com/kotx/yukata.dev)
- and [more here](https://github.com/kotx?tab=repositories&q=&type=source).

You can also check out [my blog](/b) for a sneak-peek into what I've been up to recently.
